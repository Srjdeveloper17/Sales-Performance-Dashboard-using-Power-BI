# Sales-Performance-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze sales data by region, segment, and product. Used DAX, Power Query, and data modeling to track KPIs like sales, profit, margin %, and YoY growth. Implemented slicers, drill-through, and scheduled refresh for real-time insights.
